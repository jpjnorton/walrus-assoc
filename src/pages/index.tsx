          <p>
            We are an association of individuals united by non-trivial pursuits
            of the physical and cerebral. This idea manifests in us through our
            art, our dedication to strength, and our hunger for knowledge. But
            what is this war? It is the relentless, self-imposed battle to
            always be prepared.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            We meet challenge with courage, face failure with dignity, and win
            with grace. We are disciplined, self-reliant, and uphold the trust
            placed in us. Above all, we hold ourselves accountable â€” not just to
            each other, but to the standards we set ourselves.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Our associates are racers, painters, physicists, soldiers,
            mathematicians, and more. We hold ourselves to the highest standards
            of integrity. Associates are steadfast, honorable, generous in
            spirit, open-handed in camaraderie, and unwavering in resolve.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            When we compete, display our art, or share our research, we do so
            with the confidence that we have done our utmost to be prepared for
            our trial.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            We embrace the truth that a life worth living is one of challenge.
            The value of choosing the hard right over the easy wrong is at the
            core of all we do.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            The patch is the mark of an associate. It is received once; it is
            earned daily.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>There are two ways to earn the patch:</strong>
            <br />
            1. Be nominated by an associate in good standing.
            <br />
            2. Submit a body of evidence proving adherence to association
            principles.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            From time to time, the Walrus Association will make exclusive gear
            available to associates in good standing. This gear is a mark of our
            pride and a symbol of the bond we share.
