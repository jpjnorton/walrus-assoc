# 🛠️ Backend API (TypeScript + Express)

This is a simple backend API built with **TypeScript** and **Express**. It currently supports a single `POST` endpoint that returns a hardcoded list of products. The project is ready to scale with additional routes, controllers, validation, and database integration.
